# AAMP-Crudd-Application

#Implementation Details
1. Language: C#
2. Framework: ASP.NET
3. Integrated Development Environment: Visual Studio
4. Database System: Oracle
5. Data Access: DataTableAdapters
6. Frontend Framework: Bootstrap
In developing our application, we decided to use ASP.NET and Visual Studio as our primary tools. We 
chose C# as our programming language for backend development. Visual Studio was our integrated 
development environment (IDE).
We chose Oracle as our database system to meet our data storage and recovery needs. For interaction with 
the database, we used DataTableAdapters, which are important parts of the ADO.NET framework in ASP.NET. 
These DataTableAdapters played an important role in executing SQL queries and loading data from the 
database. To ensure a flexible approach to data manipulation, we used strongly typed DataSets that provided 
type safety and flexible data manipulation.
At the front end, we have Bootstrap framework. It has collection of pre-built CSS and JavaScript components, 
we were able to create a visually appealing and functional user interface. This allowed us to deliver a unique 
user experience across devices and screen sizes.
By integrating ASP.NET, Visual Studio, Oracle, DataTableAdapters, and Bootstrap, we built user-friendly 
application that met our project goals.

#Project Description
  With AMMP, users can create user accounts, add their vehicles, and input
maintenance data such as oil changes,tire rotations, and brake replacements. The platform
provides reminders to users when the next maintenance is due based on their vehicle's
mileage or time elapsed since the last maintenance. Additionally, users can schedule
appointments with repair shops for regular maintenance and fixmechanical problems. The
system will send notifications to users to remind them of upcoming appointments and
provide information on the status of their vehicle's repairs. AMMP is user- friendly and
efficient in terms of keeping a record of all maintenance-related activities and appointments,
making it easier for vehicle owners to keep track of their vehicle's maintenance history and
ensure that their vehicle is always in good condition. The system will be implementedas a
web application that can be accessed through a browser, and will be named Auto
Maintenance & Management Platform (AMMP) to reflect its key features and capabilities.
